\indent \ One of the great challenges of our generation is that of democratizing a basic standard of living for everyone. A society with mobility and equality of opportunities is reachable if and only if we set our goals on pursuing it proactively; it's not going to happen on it's own. Both micro and macro solutions play a critical role moving towards this vision. From large scale policies intended to create an equitable and universal education systems, to small and large private sector efforts that bridge the opportunity gaps.

\indent \ Mobility is something I truly believe in. I am all for a meritocratic society, when that society gave everyone a fair and equal chance to shine. In my previous life as Director General for Research and Talent Development at Mexico's Department of Energy, I made it a priority to find those with talent and motivation but lacking opportunity. As a government agency with a large budget, we could be an agent in providing the tools for them to shine. In one of our experiments, we curated a series of MOOCs for energy education and made them freely available. Our expectations were low. There must be little demand for free education right? Wrong! We got over 30k registrations with way over 30\% completion rate. Since you work at Udemy you must be laughing: 30k? We connect students and mentors to provide affordable education opportunities for millions! If you did think this, you've just answered why Udemy inspires me and why I would be honored to work for this organization.

\indent \ I am aware I am difficult to compare to other candidates. On one end I come with seniority and a portfolio of large scale projects implemented at a national level. On the other end, I have a short, more recent career as a data scientist. I am not a senior data scientist and I am not applying for a senior management position either. Without further inspection I might look like a triangular peg in a circular hole. To that I can say: I am interested in developing a career as a data scientist. I bring to the table 3 years of experience working with data and a strong educational background in a rigorous environment (Harvard-Berkeley-Startups). I also bring to the table over 15 years of experience managing projects, building teams and detonating collaborations across disciplines and industries. If given an opportunity, I can bring the best of both worlds to your organization. I am as ready to learn and further develop my skillset as a data scientist, as I am ready to help the organization and my teammates focus on the purpose and achieve grand goals. I have enough emotional maturity to know when I need to follow and to discover when I need to step up to give more for my team and for our purpose.

\indent \ I'd be honored if given an opportunity to become a part of the Udemy family and become an acomplice to the creative distruption you are leading.
